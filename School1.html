            <p><strong>1.</strong> I have been getting consistent with honors since 10th grade, though some streaks are broken due to some stuffs, but all i care about is passing.<br><br>
            <strong>2.</strong> Some call me smart, but i really am just average, most of my knowledge came online or just researched due to boredom. I find it fun to learn new stuff especially science.<br><br>


<strong>3.</strong> I participate in some school competitions like spelling bee or quiz bee's, usually involving intellectual skills in terms of language

          <h1>Fun Facts!</h1>
          <h4>For the last section, it will be about the fun facts about me! let us start :)</h4>
          <p>  1. I only get noisy when it comes to people whom i become close with especially those with special bonds, i tend to not share my humor with others as i limit it, only talk about it to someone with the same level as me.<br><br>


2. I don't usually go with the trends of Filipino, I usually go along with the trends of people online that really gets my humor going.<br><br>


3. People think i'm smart when i'm just average, it's fun being average, if you're having fun with life,  that's how it goes for me, Life is always fun for me.
